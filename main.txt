You set async to false, when you need that ajax request to be completed before the browser passes to other codes
<script>
    // ...
    $.ajax(... async: false ...); // Hey browser! first complete this request, 
                                  // then go for other codes
    $.ajax(...); // Executed after the completion of the previous async:false request.
</script>
The Button is getting stucked and the browser appears to be blocked and user cannot do anything until the call is completed.
When async call is set to false a Synchronous call is made instead of an ASynchronous call, Synchronous call is not recommend by W3C as it blocks the page until the response is received from server
